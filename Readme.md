# HTML_PostForm-

The function of the HTML form is to show the information given in the terminal
for "Post" as opposed to "GET" 

The html needs to be run concurrently with ncat -l 9999 in terminal
 
See the difference between the forms included in the echo_server program files
when the form is submitted the form's information is seen in the terminal not in the browser.
